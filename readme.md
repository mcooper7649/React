## React
--

- What is React?
    - A JavaScript Library for building user interfaces
        - A Frontend Framework

- Why?
    - To make it easier and faster to build build beautiful interfaces
    - React allows you to create components
        
- Components
    - You can put components inside other components
    - You can re-use the same component for quick creation of elements
    - Component trees help you visually understand the component heirarchy
    - Components can be called like html tags ``<MyHeader />``
        - We are essentially creating custom html tags
    - Components keep the code clean and modular

- Component Usefulness
    - Components load their own html/css/js files  
        - This allows the components to update and refresh individually vs the whole page
            - This allows platforms to dynamically refresh their components so, things like notifications will pop up now without the need for a user to hit refresh.
